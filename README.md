#  Product demand prediction using machine learningand Linear Regression

This Python script analyzes product demand prediction using machine learning using Pandas and performs a simple linear regression using scikit-learn to predict the number of confirmed cases based on the number of cured and deceased cases. Additionally, it provides a mean squared error as a measure of the model's performance.

## Prerequisites

Before running the code, make sure you have the following libraries installed:

- Pandas
- scikit-learn (sklearn)

You can install these libraries using pip:

cmd:
    pip install pandas scikit-learn


The dataset is available in the 'dataset' folder. This folder contains two CSV files:

1. Historical Product Demand.csv
2. 1.py

Both files were obtained from Kaggle. The ' Historical Product Demand.csv' file contains the raw data. After processing the data, the results were stored in the '1.py' file.
